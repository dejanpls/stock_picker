# Stock Picker

## A Project from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-stock-picker">TOP Ruby Course</a>

### How it works
* Stock Picker takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day.
* It return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell.
* Days start at 0.

Handling of edge cases like when the lowest day is the last day or the highest day is the first day is is implemented. 
Hope you enjoy investing :+1:
